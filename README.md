# Visualize partial shading in PV modules
Partial shading is a relevant topic for any PV system operating in urban environments.
To design shade tolerant PV modules, it is crucial to know how different module configurations (i.e. all series connected or butterfly topology) operate in shaded conditions.

However, their operation under partial shading can be quite counterintuitive and it is difficult to predict which shading scenario has the biggest impact on the performance.
To compare shading scenario's and to improve our understanding of performance under partial shading, an application has been created that visualizes the IV curves in various module topologies and shading scenario's in an interactive way.
Additionally, the breakdown voltage of the cell, which is very significant in shade resilience [1], can be adjusted to see how its value changes the module IV curve.

This repository contains a zip-file with the application that can be used to test your understanding and play around with different shading scenario's.
Also, the MATLAB scripts underlying all calculations are provided.
Feel free to use this application for any educational or personal usage.
I kindly ask you to refer to this webpage when using this application or code in any form.

If you have any questions or interested in future visualization projects, feel free to reach out to y.blom@tudelft.nl
Let's work together to better understand the partial shading performance of PV modules!

With kind regards,
